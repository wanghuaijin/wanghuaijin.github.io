And my mother, she didn't have the money to send me where all the American kids went to school, but she thought it was important for me to keep up with an American education. So she decided to teach me extra lessons herself, Monday through Friday. But because she had to go to work, the only time she could do it was at 4:30 in the morning. Now as you might imagine I wasn't too happy about to get up that early. And a lot of time I'd fall asleep right there at the kitchen table.

But I am here today because I have something important to discuss with you. I am here because I want to talk with you about your education and what is expected of all of you in this new school year. Now, I've given a lot of speeches about education, and I've talked about responsibility a lot. I've talked about teacher's responsibility for inpiring students and pushing you to learn. I've talk about your parents' responsibility for making sure you stay on track, and you get your homework done and don't spend every waking hour in front of the TV or with the Xbox. I've talked a lot about your governments' responsibility for setting high standards in supporting teachers and principles, and turning around schools that aren't working, where students aren't getting the opportunities that they deserve. But at the end of the day, we can have most dedicated teachers, the most supportive parents, the best schools in the world, and none of it will make a difference, and none of it will matter unless all of you fulfill your responsibilities, unless you show up to those schools, unless you pay attention to those teachers, unless you listen to your parents and grandparents and other adults and put in the hard work it takes to succeed. That's what I want to focus on today, the responsibility each of you has for your education. I want to start with the responsibility you have to yourself. Every single one of you has something that you are good at. Every single one of you has something to offer. And you have a responsibility to yourself to discover what that is. That's the opportunity an education can provide. Maybe you could be a great writer, maybe even good enough to write a book or articles in a newspaper, but you might not know it until you write that English class paper that's assigned to you. Maybe you could be an innovator or an inventor, maybe even good enough to come up with the next iPhone or the new medicine or vaccine, but you might not know it until you do your project for your science class. Maybe you could be a mayor, or a senator, or a Supreme Court justice, but you might not know that until you join student government or the debeat team. And no matter what you want to do with your life, I guarantee that you'll need an education to do it. You want to be a doctor, or a teacher, or a police officer? You want to be a nurse or an architect, a lawyer or a member of our military? You're going to need a good education for every single one of those careers. You can not drop out school and just drop into the good job.")],-1),m=e("p",null,"[5:26.2]",-1);function g(f,w){return i(),a("div",null,[s,n(" more "),h,u,l,d,c,y,p,m])}const v=o(r,[["render",g],["__file","speech1.html.vue"]]),k=JSON.parse('{"path":"/EngLearn/speech1.html","title":"","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{"title":null,"date":"2025-01-08T00:00:00.000Z","article":false,"star":false,"timeline":false,"toc":false,"sidebar":false,"description":"Jan. 08, 2025","head":[["meta",{"property":"og:url","content":"https://wanghuaijin.github.io/EngLearn/speech1.html"}],["meta",{"property":"og:description","content":"Jan. 08, 2025"}],["meta",{"property":"og:type","content":"website"}],["meta",{"property":"og:locale","content":"en-US"}],["meta",{"property":"og:updated_time","content":"2025-01-08T06:31:59.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:author","content":"Wang Huaijin"}],["meta",{"property":"article:published_time","content":"2025-01-08T00:00:00.000Z"}],["meta",{"property":"article:modified_time","content":"2025-01-08T06:31:59.000Z"}],["script",{"type":"application/ld+json"},"{\\"@context\\":\\"https://schema.org\\",\\"@type\\":\\"WebPage\\",\\"name\\":\\"\\",\\"description\\":\\"Jan. 08, 2025\\"}"]]},"headers":[],"git":{"createdTime":1736317919000,"updatedTime":1736317919000,"contributors":[{"name":"wanghuaijin","email":"hjwang2334@163.com","commits":1}]},"readingTime":{"minutes":2.84,"words":851},"filePathRelative":"EngLearn/speech1.md","localizedDate":"January 8, 2025","excerpt":"<p>Jan. 08, 2025</p>\\n","autoDesc":true}');export{v as comp,k as data};
