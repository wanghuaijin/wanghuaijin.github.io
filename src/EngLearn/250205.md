&nbsp; Workers at the US Agency for International Development (USAID) were told to stay out of its Washington office after its website

 over the weekend, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio announcing Monday it would come under his control.

&nbsp; Rubio said in a statement the agency had "long

 of its activities ahead of a "potential reorganization."

&nbsp; But there was widespread confusion, as some 600 staffers found themselves locked out of their computer systems, ABC News reported.
