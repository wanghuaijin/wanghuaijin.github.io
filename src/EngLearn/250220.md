## Powerful quantum computers in years not decades, says Microsoft

&nbsp; Microsoft has unveiled a new chip called Majorana 1 that it says will enable the creation of quantum computers able to solve "meaningful, industrial-scale problems in years, not decades".

&nbsp; It is the latest development in quantum computing - tech which uses principles of particle physics to create a new type of computer able to solve problems ordinary computers cannot.

&nbsp; Creating quantum computers powerful enough to solve important real-world problems is very challenging - and some experts believe them to be decades away.

&nbsp; Microsoft says this timetable can now be

 up because of the "transformative" progress it has made in developing the new chip involving a "topological conductor", based on a new material it has produced.

&nbsp; The firm believes its topoconductor has the potential to be as revolutionary as the semiconductor was in the history of computing.
