 analysis using the price of a McDonald's Big Mac hamburger, the popular fast-food item available worldwide, which is often used as an international price index.

&nbsp; The analysis found that workers in Japan can buy 2.18 Big Mac hamburgers for their one hour of work at a restaurant or retail shop, compared to 3.95 in Australia and 2.56 in China's Hong Kong. The number in Japan also means a decrease of 0.2 hamburgers from five years ago as wages have risen slower than prices.
