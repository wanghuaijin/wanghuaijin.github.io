### Major Chinese port hit by congestion ahead of holiday, Trump tariff threat[^t1]

&nbsp; Exporters this week

 load and ship cargo from Shenzhen's Yantian Port, one of the world's largest container ports, before an eight-day Lunar New Year holiday and ahead of a potential wave of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.[^s1]


&nbsp; Yantian, which handles one-third of Guangdong's international trade and one-quarter of China's exports to the United States, already increased the 
<span class="hover-note">

<span class="hover-content">

 on containers by 15% to 15,000 
<span class="hover-note">

</span></span>
 during Jan. 20-28, the port said in a statement on Wednesday.[^s2]


&nbsp; It took Li Guoliang, a truck driver, two hours on Thursday evening to transport a loaded container to a 
<span class="hover-note">

<span class="hover-content">

</span></span>
 at the port - quadrupling the time he spends on normal days.[^s3]


&nbsp; "The major reason is that factories rushed to ship before the holiday, and limited container quota at the port and space at container yards resulted in the congestion," Li told Reuters.[^s4]


&nbsp; Another truck company told Reuters that a driver 
<span class="hover-note">

<span class="hover-content">

</span></span>
 the port area for more than 24 hours on Thursday.[^s5]



&nbsp; U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that his administration was discussing a 10% punitive duty on Chinese 
<span class="hover-note">

<span class="hover-content">

</span></span>
 with Feb. 1 a potential deadline for a decision, which could hurt U.S. demand for Chinese products.[^s6]

&nbsp; The Chinese commerce ministry said on Thursday that China was willing to work with the United States to promote stable and healthy development of economic and trade ties, when asked about Trump's threat of fresh tariffs.[^s7]


&nbsp; Chinese factories and U.S. buyers had taken action long before Trump took office earlier this week.[^s8]


&nbsp; Some U.S. companies had frontloaded shipments of toys, furniture and

 and built up 
<span class="hover-note">

<span class="hover-content">

</span></span>
 ahead of any new Trump tariffs, driving China's exports to the U.S. in December.[^s9]

&nbsp; In 2024, container

 at Yantian grew nearly 7% year-on-year to a record 17.365 million standard containers. That

</span></span>
 the 14.6% jump in Shenzhen's exports last year to a new all-time high of 2.81 trillion yuan.[^s10]

&nbsp; As the congestion at Yantian Port worsened this week, trucking fees rose,

&nbsp; Trucking fees from Shenzhen's Fuyong, a logistics hub, to Yantian Port rose to more than 2,500 yuan ($345) from 1,000 yuan prior.[^s12]


&nbsp; Due to congestion at Yantian, there may also be an additional container

[^t1]: 中国主要港口在假期和特朗普关税威胁前遭遇拥堵

[^s1]: 在为期八天的农历新年假期之前，以及在美国可能对中国商品征收一波关税之前，出口商本周竞相从深圳盐田港装载和发运货物。盐田港是全球最大的集装箱港口之一。

[^s2]: 在周三的一份声明中说，盐田港处理广东省三分之一的国际贸易，占中国对美出口的四分之一，其在1月20日至28日期间，已将每日集装箱配额提高15%，至1.5万箱。

[^s3]: 周四晚上，卡车司机Li Guoliang花了两个小时将一个装满货物的集装箱运送到港口的一个集装箱堆场，这是他平时所花时间的四倍。

[^s4]: “主要原因是工厂赶在节前出货，而港口有限的集装箱配额和集装箱堆场空间导致了拥堵，”Li告诉路透社。

[^s5]: 另一家卡车公司告诉路透社，周四一名司机被困在港口地区超过24小时。

[^s6]: 美国总统特朗普（Donald Trump）周二说，美国正在讨论对中国进口商品征收10%的惩罚性关税，2月1日可能是做出决定的最后期限，这可能会损害美国对中国产品的需求。

[^s7]: 周四，当被问及特朗普威胁征收新关税时，中国商务部表示，中国愿意与美国合作，促进经贸关系的稳定健康发展。

[^s8]: 早在特朗普本周早些时候上任之前，中国工厂和美国买家就已经采取了行动。

[^s9]: 一些美国公司提前装运了玩具、家具和电子产品，并在特朗普征收任何新关税之前建立了库存，推动了12月份中国对美国的出口。

[^s10]: 2024年，盐田集装箱吞吐量同比增长近7%，达到创纪录的1736.5万标准箱。这与去年深圳出口增长14.6%，达到人民币2.81万亿元的历史新高相符。

[^s11]: 随着本周盐田港拥堵情况的恶化，货运费用上涨，损害了出口商的利润。

[^s12]: 从物流中心深圳福永到盐田港的货运费用从之前的1,000元涨至2,500元（345美元）以上。

[^s13]: 由于盐田港口的拥堵，可能还会有超过1000元的额外集装箱卸货费。

[^s14]: Li说，特朗普的关税威胁是造成拥堵的原因。

[^s15]: “如果没有关系，工厂为什么不在农历新年假期后发货呢？”
