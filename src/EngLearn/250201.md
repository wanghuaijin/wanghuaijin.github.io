&nbsp; Gascon said she was "deeply sorry to those I have caused pain," in a statement sent to AFP via a Netflix spokeswoman on Friday.

&nbsp; Many of the social media posts, which date back to at least 2016, specifically criticize Islam and Muslims. Gascon described Islam as

 and "a deeply disgusting type of humanity."
