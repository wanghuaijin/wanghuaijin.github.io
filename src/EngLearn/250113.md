### California Fire Victims Whose Insurance Was Cut Have Few Legal Options[^t1]

&nbsp; As wildfires

</span></span>
 areas of Los Angeles in California, destroying thousands of homes and businesses, the decision last year by its largest insurer State Farm to reduce its number of policyholders in at-risk areas has caught fresh attention.[^s1]


&nbsp; State Farm CEO Denies Hardin wrote in a March 2024 letter to California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara that the insurer's

exposure to risk,

</span></span>
 and higher rates alone weren't enough.[^s2]


&nbsp; "We have been reluctant to take this step, recognizing how difficult it will be for impacted policyholders … We are striving to minimize the impact of the necessary actions that must be taken," Hardin wrote.[^s3]

[^t1]: 加州火灾受害者的保险被削减，他们几乎没有法律选择

[^s1]: 随着野火肆虐加州洛杉矶地区，摧毁了成千上万的房屋和企业，加州最大的保险公司State Farm去年决定减少危险地区的保单持有人数量，这引起了新的关注。

[^s2]: State Farm首席执行官Denies Hardin在2024年3月给加州保险专员Ricardo Lara的一封信中写道，保险公司紧张的财务状况迫使他们采取措施减少风险敞口，仅仅靠提高利率是不够的。

[^s3]: Hardin写道：“我们一直不愿采取这一步骤，因为我们意识到受影响的保单持有人将面临多么大的困难……我们正在努力将必须采取的必要行动的影响降到最低。”

[^s4]: State Farm并不是孤立的事件。加州的其他保险公司也削减了他们的政策以减少风险。根据加州保险局（CDI）的数据，在过去四年里，加州12家顶级保险公司中有7家削减了该州的保险范围。

[^s5]: 考虑到洛杉矶毁灭性的大火，放弃保单持有人的决定是否会使州立农业保险公司和其他保险公司面临来自前客户的法律风险？

[^s6]: State Farm保险公司没有取消保单。他们选择不续签保单，根据各州的法律，保险公司可以这样做。

[^s7]: 如果保险公司的不续保是任意的或歧视性的，那就是非法的。
