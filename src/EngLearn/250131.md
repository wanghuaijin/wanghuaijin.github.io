[^t1]: 一名在瑞典焚烧《可兰经》的伊拉克男子被杀

[^s1]: 斯德哥尔摩的一名法官星期四说，一名在瑞典焚烧《可兰经》的伊拉克男子已经死亡。瑞典媒体报道称，他在附近城市的一次枪击中丧生。

[^s2]: 2023年，38岁的Salwan Momika在瑞典多次焚烧和亵渎伊斯兰教的圣书。焚烧《古兰经》的视频在世界范围内广为传播，在几个穆斯林国家引发了愤怒和批评，导致许多地方发生骚乱和动荡。

[^s3]: 斯德哥尔摩地方法院表示，原定于周四对莫尼卡进行审判的判决被推迟，因为其中一名被告已经死亡。法庭法官Göran Lundahl证实死者就是Momika。他说他不知道莫妮卡是何时以及如何死亡的。

[^s4]: 警方说，周三晚上，他们接到警报，在斯德哥尔摩附近的Sodertalje的一栋公寓楼里发生了枪击事件，并发现了一名有枪伤的男子。后来他死了，初步的谋杀调查开始了。

[^s5]: 广播公司SVT报道称，受害者是Momika，但没有透露消息来源。据称，Momika于2018年从伊拉克来到瑞典，并于2021年获得了为期三年的居留许可。

[^s6]: 瑞典TT通讯社报道，检察官说，夜间有五人被捕。

[^s7]: 据TT报道，瑞典首相乌尔夫·克里斯滕松（Ulf Kristersson）表示，瑞典安全部门之所以参与其中，是因为“显然存在与外国势力有联系的风险”。

[^s8]: Momika和一名同案被告在8月份被指控煽动仇恨，因为他们发表了与焚烧可兰经有关的言论。判决本应在周四上午宣布。
