### 1. LGBTQ+ couples in Thailand register their marriages on the first day of law giving them equal status[^t1]

&nbsp; Hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples in Thailand are expected to make their wedded status legal Thursday, the first day a law

</span></span>
 granting them the same rights as

 couples.[^s1]

&nbsp; The

<span class="hover-content">
颁布
</span></span>
 of the Marriage Equality Act makes Thailand the first country in Southeast Asia and the third place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, after China's Taiwan Province and Nepal.[^s2]


&nbsp; The marriage equality bill, which

 the Civil and Commercial Code to change the words “men and women” and “husband and wife” to “individuals” and “marriage partners.” It is supposed to open up access to full legal, financial and medical rights for LGBTQ+ couples.[^s3]

&nbsp; Thailand has a reputation for

and 
<span class="hover-note">
inclusivity,

and thousands of people from around the world attend the annual Bangkok Pride parade. But rights advocates have struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law in a largely conservative society where members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life, although they note that things have improved greatly in recent years.[^s5]


[^t1]: 泰国的LGBTQ+夫妇在法律生效的第一天登记结婚，给予他们平等的地位

[^s1]: 泰国数百对LGBTQ+伴侣有望在周四正式结婚，这是泰国法律赋予他们与异性恋伴侣同等权利的第一天。

[^s2]: 《婚姻平权法》的颁布使泰国成为东南亚第一个、亚洲第三个将同性婚姻合法化的国家，仅次于中国台湾省和尼泊尔。

[^s3]: 婚姻平等法案在议会两院顺利通过，修改了民商法，将“男人和女人”和“丈夫和妻子”改为“个人”和“婚姻伴侣”。它应该为LGBTQ+夫妇提供全面的法律、经济和医疗权利。

[^s4]: 合伙人在处理共同资产、纳税义务和扣减、继承权和遗属福利方面拥有平等的权利和责任。

[^s5]: 泰国以接纳和包容而闻名，来自世界各地的数千人参加一年一度的曼谷骄傲游行。但权利倡导者几十年来一直在努力争取在一个基本上保守的社会中通过婚姻平等法。LGBTQ+社区的成员表示，他们在日常生活中面临歧视，尽管他们指出，近年来情况有了很大改善。
